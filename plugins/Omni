  Class: Omni
  Encode mono signal as omnidirectional soundfield

  An omnidirectional soundfield can be regarded in two ways:
  A soundfield with an infinite number of planewaves arriving in all
  directions, or a soundfield with no directions. In a well aligned,
  dampend studio environment, this usually sounds "in the head",
  while in concert hall listening usually appears as omnipresent.

  To control the soundfield, Push and Focus can be applied to
  either "push" or "focus" an omnidirectional soundfield into a
  planewave, giving the soundfield an angle of arrival.

  Reaper is treating mono files as stereo files with identical
  content for left and right channel. Hence this plugin is set to
  expect a stereo signal in. The stereo signal will be mixed to mono
  before encoding.
