DESCRIPTION::
Adjust the soundfield directivity of a first order ambisonic signal (B-format) across the origin.


NOTE::
link::Classes/FoaDirectO:: is usually called via the convenience wrapper link::Classes/FoaTransform::.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

argument:: w
Input signal W.

argument:: x
Input signal X.

argument:: y
Input signal Y.

argument:: z
Input signal Z.

argument:: angle
The distortion angle, in radians. 0 to pi/2

argument:: mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument:: add
This value will be added to the output.

discussion::

strong::Angle:: = 0 retains the current directivity of the soundfield. Increasing strong::angle:: towards pi/2 decreases the directivity, reducing the gains on the directional compenents to zero, and is equivalent to a spatial low-pass filter. The resulting image becomes omnidirectional or directionless.
