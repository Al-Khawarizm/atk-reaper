DESCRIPTION::
Adjust the soundfield directivity of a first order ambisonic signal (B-format) along the z-axis. link::Classes/FoaDirectZ:: is usually called via the convenience wrapper link::Classes/FoaTransform::.


NOTE::
Part of the Ambisonic Toolkit, a soundfield kernel synthesis, processing and rendering library.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

argument:: w
Input signal W.

argument:: x
Input signal X.

argument:: y
Input signal Y.

argument:: z
Input signal Z.

argument:: angle
The distortion angle, in radians. 0 to pi/2

argument:: mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument:: add
This value will be added to the output.


discussion::

strong::Angle:: = 0 retains the current directivity of the soundfield. Increasing strong::angle:: towards pi/2 decreases the directivity along the z-axis, reducing the gain on this axis to zero, and is equivalent to a spatial low-pass filter. The resulting image becomes directionless on the z-axis.
