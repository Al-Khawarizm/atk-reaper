Thanks for checking out Ambisonic Toolkit for Reaper!
Below is some information that might be of use.



FIRST OF: A QUEST FOR OSX USERS:
================================

The installer package is not code signed by Apple. Could you please help me checking
out if this prevents it from running if securiy is set to allow only applications
from Apple and identified users?

You find the settings to control it here:

Apple Menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Allow Apps downloaded from Anywhere



FEEDBACK, SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS
=====================================

For the time being, the easiest is to just e-mail feedback to me at:

trond.lossius@bek.no

Alternatively you can use the JS plugins issue tracker:

- http://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/wiki/tiki-view_tracker.php?trackerId=6

If you end up using the plugins for some project, I would be more
than interested to know.


INSTALLING ON WINDOWS
=====================

1) Start reaper
2) From the Options menu choose "Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder"
3) Unzip the ATK for Reaper archive.
4) 

WHAT GETS INSTALLED WHERE (OSX)?
================================

All files are installed into various folders in your home library folder:

~/Library/Application Support/ATK
~/Library/Application Support/Reaper/Effects/ATK

and an alias (or rather a symlink for the technically inclined)

~/Library/Application Support/Reaper/Data/ATK
 (the symlink points to ~/Library/Application Support/ATK)

If you are also using Ambisonic Toolkit with SuperCollider,
the convolution kernels are installed in the same place and
have the exact same content, so I do not expect you to
experience any conflicts.

If you want to take a look at the installed files and do not see the 
Library folder in Finder,  please press the ALT button while clicking
the "Go" menu in Finder. The Library folder will show up as an 
additional option.



NEED SOME SOUND FILES TO PLAY AROUND?
=====================================

You can find a collection of sound files here:

http://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Downloads


Additional sound files can be grabbed from these fine sources:

- http://ambisonia.com/
- http://www.freesound.org/browse/tags/B-format/
- http://www.surround-library.com/ (commercial library ambisonic sound effects)
- http://www.spheric-collection.com/ (commercial library ambisonic sound effects)

And most of the catalogue of Nimbus records are UHJ recordings:
